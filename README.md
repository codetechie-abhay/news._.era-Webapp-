+ Basically this is a React App which takes the data from the NEWSAPI and fetch the data.

+ An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that specifies how different software components should interact with each other. APIs are used to allow different applications to communicate with each other and share data, resources, or functionalities.

## **News API**

> The News API is an API (Application Programming Interface) that provides access to news articles from various sources, including news websites, blogs, and other online publications. It allows developers to retrieve news articles and related metadata, such as author, title, date, and content, and use them in their applications.
+ With the News API, developers can search and filter news articles based on various criteria, including keyword, source, language, country, category, and more. They can also get live updates on breaking news and receive notifications when new articles matching their criteria are published.
+ The News API is widely used by developers to create news aggregators, personalized news feeds, and other news-related applications. It is available as a RESTful API, meaning that requests and responses are sent and received over HTTP using standard HTTP methods such as GET and POST.
+ Some popular news organizations that provide access to their content through the News API include CNN, BBC, The New York Times, and The Guardian, among others.

## **React JS**
> React JS is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces (UIs) for web applications. React JS is focused on providing a way to build UI components in a more structured and reusable manner, making it easier to manage complex user interfaces.

With React JS, developers can create reusable UI components and use them to build complex interfaces for web applications. React JS uses a declarative approach, which means developers define what they want to see on the UI, and React takes care of updating the UI when the underlying data changes.

## **React DOM**
>React DOM also provides a way to interact with the DOM elements directly, through the use of refs. Refs provide a way to get a reference to a specific DOM element rendered by a React component, allowing you to manipulate the element directly, for example, to change its styles or to focus an input field.

In summary, React DOM is a package in React that provides the necessary tools for rendering React components to the browser's DOM, updating the DOM efficiently, and interacting with the DOM elements directly.
